              VRFSpec defines the basic structure of a Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instance/context. A VRF has one single Route
              Distinguisher (RD) and a set of Route Targets (RTs), which can be empty. RTs define how the VRF learns about extra routes.

                    RouteTarget defines the structure for a single route target in a VRF. A RT is essentially an extended BGP

                    families (IPv4, IPv6), and might be also added to the EVPN via the ipv4-evpn and ipv6-evpn address families.
